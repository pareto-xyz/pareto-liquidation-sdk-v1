Pareto Liquidation SDK V1

If accounts on Pareto's exchange fall under margin, then they are at risk of being liquidated. The liquidation is decentralized such that any account can claim the liquidated position(s) from the user. Liquidators are provided a reward per position liquidated. 

This repo contains a Python SDK with scripts to find accounts below margin and to perform liquidations. Please note that liquidations are not a risk-free endeavor. Proceed at your own risk.

## Setup

Install the package locally:

`pip install -e ./`
